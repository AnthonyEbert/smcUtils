trunk: the current stable version of the code. Bug fixes on the main
       code happens here, while adding new functionality etc happens in a branch.

branches: a directory containing subdirectories, 
          each subdirectory is an svn copy of trunk (at some point)
          aimed at solving a particular problem

          To create a new branch called `new-branch' use
              git branch new-branch 
          and then
              git checkout new-branch
          to actually work on the branch.

tags: contains subdirectories containing release versions of trunk,
      i.e. when we submit a paper, we should create a tag with that version
      or if we have an R package, we will put it here. The idea is that once this
      directory is created, we never modify it. To create a tag, we will make 
      an svn copy as above.
